# intellij_unit_tests
Advanced Java Topics assignment where I use Java tests to conduct experiments.
WORD OF CAUTION: ALL EXAMPLE CASES WILL USE THE DEFAULT CONSTRUCTOR.

Method #1 - toString ()
  You need to inscribe all of your information in a nice, yet easy to read fashion. The data here should be organized by line and data type.
  
  Expected output: "false 
                    
                    0 1 2"
  
Method #2 - simpleIf ()
  You want to filter out your experimental class by the total length of the strings used in the input, with the balance of using the test boolean datum.
  
  Expected output: false 

Method #3 - ifAndElif ()
  You want to test out how your test boolean works alongside the boolean operators.
  
  Expect output: false

Method #4 - ifAndElse ()
  After realizing you want to test your non-boolean data as well, you decide to sum up your numbers, and determine what string comes out instead.
  
  Expected output: ""

Method #5 - whileLoop ()
  When you realize that you can concentate the same string as many times as the while loop can allow you.
  
  Expected output: ""

Method #6 - forLoop ()
  You remember that multiplication is repeated addition, and decide to design an algorithm to accomplish this via for loop.
  
  Expected output: 10

Method #7 - oneDArray ()
  You need to complete a more specialized toString method, but with arrays as the storage mechanism.
  
  Expected ouput: " "

Method #8 - twoDArray ()
  You want to form a primitive data analysis that simply forms a "table", but with the original data being tripled.
  
  Expected output: "0 1 2
                    0 3 6"

Method #9 - inArrayList (int input)
  You have created a brute-force method of searching. It only needs two strings to function, but input.
  
  Expect output: true
