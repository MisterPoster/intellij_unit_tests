# intellij_unit_tests
Advanced Java Topics assignment where I use Java tests to conduct experiments.
WORD OF CAUTION: ALL EXAMPLE CASES WILL USE THE DEFAULT CONSTRUCTOR.

Method #1 - toString ()
  You need to inscribe all of your information in a nice, yet easy to read fashion. The data here   should be organized by line and data type.
  
  Expected output: "false/n /n0 1 2"
  
Method #2 - simpleIf ()
  You want to filter out your experimental class by the total length of the strings used in the     input, with the balance of using the test boolean datum.
  
  Expected output: "false/n /n0 1 2" //
